    "##The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Swahili speaking international observers, journalists, policy analysts, and interested parties face a significant language and data barrier in monitoring the rapidly evolving political landscape, elections, and general state of the nation in Tanzania. The majority of real-time public discourse and immediate political reaction occurs on social media platforms (such as Twitter/X) primarily in the Swahili language.\n",
    "##The Consequence\n",
    "Currently, deriving real-time insights requires the resource-intensive and often delayed process of manual translation of thousands of individual Swahili social media posts. This leads to an inefficient, incomplete, and potentially biased understanding of the public's real sentiment, trust levels, and immediate response to political events and candidates, hindering timely and informed decision-making or analysis.\n",
    "##The Objective\n",
    "To bridge this critical intelligence gap, there is a need for an automated, real-time political intelligence dashboard. This system must ingest high-volume, Swahili-language social media data, automatically perform advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, and present the findings via an intuitive, English-language visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dashboard must provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Aggregate Sentiment: A comprehensive, real-time sentiment score for the overall political state of the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic-Specific Analysis: Breakdown of sentiment and a calculated \"Trust Score\" for key political topics, parties, or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution will allow non-Swahili speaking users to instantaneously grasp the current political mood and state of public trust without the need for manual translation, enabling clearer, data-driven political awareness."

    "# Phase 1 → Preparing the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we **set up everything needed to predict sentiment** for Swahili political tweets using AfriSenti.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install libraries**  \n",
    "   We need:\n",
    "   - `transformers` (for the model)  \n",
    "   - `torch` (for deep learning)  \n",
    "   - `pandas` (for data handling)  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import modules**  \n",
    "   Load PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and Hugging Face transformers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load the AfriSenti model**  \n",
    "   We use a pretrained sentiment analysis model trained on African social media text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Move model to GPU**  \n",
    "   If a GPU is available, it will make predictions faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define prediction function** – `predict_sentiment(text)`:\n",
    "   - Converts text into model-friendly tokens.\n",
    "   - Runs the model to get raw scores.\n",
    "   - Converts scores to probabilities with `softmax`.\n",
    "   - Returns a readable label (`positive`, `neutral`, `negative`) with confidence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test the setup**  \n",
    "   Try a few Swahili sentences to make sure it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "Prepare the environment so that in **Phase 3** we can **predict sentiment for all tweets** and use these predictions to calculate Trust Scores later.\n"

    "\n",
    "For our hackathon project, **our team built a synthetic dataset of political tweets in Swahili**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because live Twitter scraping is unreliable—APIs can block requests or limit access—we decided to simulate realistic tweets with all the features needed for sentiment and trust analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What our team generated for each tweet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User info:**  \n",
    "  - Username & full name (realistic Swahili-style handles)  \n",
    "  - Verified status  \n",
    "  - Followers, following, and total posts  \n",
    "  - Account creation date\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tweet content:**  \n",
    "  - Topical phrases about `#ChaguziTZ`, `chaguzi`, `#Suluhu`, or political campaigns  \n",
    "  - Randomly added hashtags and trending words\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engagement metrics:**  \n",
    "  - Likes, retweets, replies, quotes  \n",
    "  - Device type (Twitter for Android, iPhone, Web, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced features for trust scoring:**  \n",
    "  - Account age  \n",
    "  - Follower-to-following ratio  \n",
    "  - Verified status  \n",
    "  - Posting consistency  \n",
    "  - Engagement velocity  \n",
    "  - Temporal freshness\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we did it as a team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User pool creation:** Each team member contributed ideas for realistic Swahili-style usernames and names.  \n",
    "2. **Tweet generation:** Randomly combined phrases and topics to simulate real social media conversations.  \n",
    "3. **Metrics simulation:** Created likes, retweets, replies, and other engagement metrics programmatically.  \n",
    "4. **Trust features:** Computed scores like account consistency, engagement velocity, and temporal freshness.  \n",
    "5. **Quality check:** Ensured all tweets were unique and realistic.  \n",
    "6. **Export:** Saved the final dataset as `tanzania_swahili_political_raw.csv` for the next phases (sentiment analysis and trust scoring).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "Produce a realistic dataset of 600 Swahili political tweets that our hackathon team can use for **Phase 3 sentiment prediction** and **Phase 4 Trust Score calculations**.\n"

    "   - Also recorded the model’s confidence/probability for each prediction.  \n",
    "4. **Save results:** Stored the predictions in a new CSV file: `tanzania_swahili_political_sentiment.csv`.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Provide sentiment labels for each tweet, so we can combine them with trust metrics in Phase 4 for a **complete analysis of credibility and opinion trends**.  \n",
